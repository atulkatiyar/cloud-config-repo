AWS RDS automatically creates backups for your Aurora PostgreSQL database. However, automated backups do not occur in real-time or close to real-time.

How Automated Backups Work in AWS RDS
Backup Frequency:

Automated backups are taken once per day during a specified backup window.
AWS also captures transaction logs every 5 minutes to allow point-in-time recovery.
Storage Location:

The backup data, including snapshots and transaction logs, is stored in Amazon S3 by AWS.
Real-Time Backup?

No, automated snapshots are not real-time. They occur at a scheduled time once a day.
However, point-in-time recovery (PITR) allows restoring data from transaction logs to a specific moment.
Checking the Last Backup Time
The screenshot shows:
Snapshot Creation Time: January 14, 2025, at 02:03 UTC
Instance Creation Time: January 10, 2025, at 04:31 UTC
This suggests that the latest backup was taken on schedule, not in real-time.
Alternative for Near-Real-Time Backups
If you need backups closer to real-time, consider:

Manual Snapshots – You can create snapshots anytime.
Cross-Region Replication – Continuously replicates data to another region.
AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) – For real-time replication.
Aurora Backtrack – Allows rolling back within a set time frame.
Would you like guidance on setting up one of these solutions?
