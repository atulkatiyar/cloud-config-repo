In the context of Amazon RDS, the retention period of 7 days means the following:

Automated Backups:

Amazon RDS automatically creates backups of your database within the specified retention period.
In this case, RDS will retain these automated backups for 7 days.
You can restore your database to any point in time within this 7-day retention window.
Cluster-Level Retention:

Since this is an Aurora cluster, the backup retention period applies to the entire cluster, not just individual instances. Both the writer and reader instances are part of the same cluster and share the same backup settings.
Automated backups for Aurora are incremental, meaning they capture only changes made after the last backup, while maintaining the ability to restore to any point in time within the retention period.
Data Recovery:

If you accidentally delete the database or encounter data corruption, you can restore the database to any time within the past 7 days.
Impact of Retention Period:

The longer the retention period, the more storage is consumed by the backup snapshots.
For Aurora, automated backups are stored in Amazon S3, and the cost depends on the retention period and the size of the database.
If you want a longer or shorter retention period, you can modify this setting in the RDS console under the cluster configuration settings. Keep in mind that changing the retention period will apply to the entire Aurora cluster.



1. Automated Backups Frequency
Amazon Aurora continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3 as part of its automated backup feature.
These backups are incremental and occur continuously (i.e., Aurora captures changes in near real-time).
You don't need to configure a specific frequency for automated backups since they are managed by AWS.
2. Point-in-Time Recovery
Since Aurora backs up data continuously, you can perform Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) to restore your database to any specific second within the 7-day retention period. This continuous backup capability is a key difference from traditional snapshot-based systems.
3. Manual Snapshots
If you need a specific backup at a particular time, you can create a manual snapshot. Manual snapshots are user-initiated and not automatically managed by the retention period. They will remain in your account until you delete them

Automated backups are not explicitly tied to a user-accessible S3 bucket. Instead, AWS uses S3 internally to store these backups, and the user doesn't have direct access to the bucket storing the snapshot.

1. Enable Cross-Account Snapshot Sharing
Amazon RDS Aurora allows sharing manual DB snapshots across AWS accounts.

Steps:
Create a Manual Snapshot:

Go to the Amazon RDS Console in the source account.
Select the Aurora cluster and create a manual snapshot.
Action → Take Snapshot → Provide a name.
Share the Snapshot:

After the snapshot is created:
Go to Snapshots in the RDS Console.
Select the snapshot and choose Actions → Share Snapshot.
Add the destination AWS account ID.
Ensure the snapshot is not encrypted. If encrypted:
Share the encryption key (KMS key) with the destination account.
KMS Console → Customer managed keys → Select the key → Add permissions for the destination account.
Restore Snapshot in the Destination Account:

Log in to the destination AWS account.
Go to RDS Console → Snapshots.
Select the shared snapshot and restore it as a new Aurora cluster.
Verify Data Integrity:

Access the restored Aurora cluster in the destination account.
Verify that all data has been restored successfully.
2. Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
AWS DMS provides a near-zero downtime migration option.

Steps:
Set Up DMS in the Source Account:

Launch an AWS DMS replication instance in the source account.
Configure source (Aurora cluster in source account) and target endpoints (Aurora cluster in destination account).
Enable Continuous Replication:

Start a full load migration and enable CDC (Change Data Capture) to continuously replicate changes.
Verify Migration:

Once the migration is complete, verify the data in the destination Aurora cluster.
Switch to the Destination Database:

After validation, point your applications to the destination database.
