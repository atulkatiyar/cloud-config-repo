https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/migrate-an-amazon-rds-db-instance-to-another-vpc-or-account.html

We actually ended up using DMS for this migration. What we did was:

Take a snapshot of the target DB in the original account.
Share the snapshot to the target account and restore it over there. (You have to use snapshot for migrating things like triggers, custom types, sequence, etc)
Setup connections (like VPC peering or security groups) between two accounts.
Setup DMS in source account (endpoints, replication instance, task)
Write SQL to temporarily disable/delete constraints, triggers, etc which may cause error when load source data.
Using DMS to load source data and enable ongoing replication.
Enable/add constraints, triggers, etc back.
Post migration test
